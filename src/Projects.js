            <h1>Welcome to my workshop of innovation and code</h1>
            <p>Here, you'll discover a diverse portfolio of projects that encapsulate my passion for 
                technology and problem-solving. Explore the cutting edge of artificial intelligence 
                with an ML-based text summarizer, trace the interconnected data flows of a Graph API, 
                delve into the efficient elegance of a Huffman Coding text compressor, immerse yourself 
                in the crafted world of a mini video game, and accelerate your reading with a 
                JavaScript-driven speed reader. Each project represents a unique challenge and a 
                skill honed. These projects are a testament to my journey in software engineering-a 
                journey marked by continual learning and a desire to push the boundaries of what's possible. 
                I invite you to play around with them, examine their inner workings, and see for yourself 
                the outcomes of dedication and creativity.</p>
