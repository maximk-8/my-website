            <h1>Hi there!</h1>
            <p>My name is Maxim. I graduated from UC San Diego in March 2023 with a Bachelor of 
                Science in Computer Science. With a strong academic record, I blend a rigorous 
                educational background with hands-on experience in software engineering. Embarking 
                on a comprehensive exploration of computer science, my journey has equipped me with 
                a deep understanding of complex problem-solving, intelligent system design, and the 
                assurance of technological robustness. This experience has granted me a profound 
                insight into the interplay between theoretical foundations and their practical 
                applications in the tech landscape.</p>
            <p>During my internship at General Atomics, I engaged deeply with flight-critical software, 
                sharpening my analytical skills and playing a pivotal role in enhancing system safety 
                and performance. My proactive approach to problem-solving and meticulous attention to 
                code quality were instrumental in accelerating software delivery and strengthening system 
                robustness.</p>
            <p>Since graduating from UC San Diego, I have immersed myself in a variety of projects that 
                have broadened my technical expertise and provided extensive hands-on experience. This 
                continuous journey of learning and application has not only solidified my proficiency in 
                a range of technologies but also honed my ability to craft dynamic solutions that meet 
                complex challenges. My commitment to technology extends beyond academic knowledge, embracing 
                the practical intricacies of software development and the innovative spirit of the industry.</p>
            <p>As a technology enthusiast and proactive problem solver, I am proficient in a variety of 
                programming languages and tools. With a readiness to embrace challenges and a drive to 
                extend the limits of what's possible in software development, I am eager to collaborate 
                and innovate.</p>
